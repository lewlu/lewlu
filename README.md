## Welcome to The Life of Lewlu

""Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and eat and sleep with the earth." - Walt Whitman" - The cap of my Honest Tea

My name is Lauren Elizabeth Whalen, and my nickname is Lulu because my brother, also a computer science major, couldn't pronounce Lauren when we were babies. Then, it took me until high school to realize that LEW are my initials and can be combined with lulu to make LEWLU. And what a nice and concise instagram handle that is! :) Onto my story:

# How I Overcome Imposter Syndrome

On impostor-syndrome as a woman in STEM:

I am computer engineering major and the idea of impostor syndrome resonates with me because most of my classmates came in with more coding knowledge than I. To overcome this feeling of not deserving my accomplishments, I look at all facets of my life and know that I am challenging myself with where I am and that people always compare themselves with someone better than them.  I have very intelligent classmates that take 21 credit hours, get all A's, and have a job and then they compare themselves with the CEO of Google while I'm freaking out about how someone had an internship with my dream company Tesla last summer.  Realizing that we are reaching towards and working towards high goals in our lives throughout our whole lives, is all we need to know. These are our lives, not others'. We will win at goals made by us for us, not by others or for others. Only compare yourself to who you were yesterday and do not get discouraged by your failures or others' wins.

## That Above Advice I posted on BrightCrowd
I love **BrightCrowd**, it is that grey area between LinkedIn and Facebook, where you can ask for or give advice on professional matters while connected with people who have similar career goals / life aspirations.
Here is my page:

Then, I also like **LinkedIn** because I can update people on where my career is headed, and present myself alongside my resume, and see what my peers are doing to change the world!

### <NOTES FOR ME> Jekyll Themes
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
  
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lewlu/lewlu/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

How exciting:
I can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/lewlu/lewlu/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
